Q) How many edges does a minimum spanning tree for above example?
Ans: No. of edges of MST = |V|-1 = |10|-1 = 9
Q) In a graph G. let the edge u v have the least weight. is it true that u v is always part of
any minimum spanning tree of G? Justify your answers.
Ans: Proof by contradiction:
Let us assume that the MST does not contain the edge having least weight. If we try to
include the least weight edge into our tree there will be cycle. So now we can remove
another edge and add the least weight edge and form MST having lower weight. Hence
the previous MST was incorrect. Therefore, the least weight edge will always be included
in the MST.
Q) Let G be a graph and T be a minimum spanning tree of G. Suppose that the
weight of an edge e is decreased. How can you find the minimum spanning
tree of the modified graph? What is the runtime of your solution?
Ans: Given G be graph with n vertices and T be an minimum cost spanning tree.
Let us consider (a, b) be an edge not in T whose weight is decreased.
(1) Using DFS find the simple path from a to b in T.
(2) Find an edge weight e on that unique path which is maximum among all edge weight.
(3) Now check if weight of e is greater than that of (a, b), then replace e in T with edge (a,
b).
This can be done in linear time
Q) Find order of edges for Kruskal's and Prim's?
Ans: The edges in Kruskal’s Algorithm can be discontinuous as it selects the
edges with minimum weight as that to Prim’s algorithm which forms MST in a
continuous connected edges pattern.
